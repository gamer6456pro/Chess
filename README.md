# Chess
First large scale project I made and includes a doc to help others!\
This version doesn't include an AI but it still has all the features of chess!\
The Doc is here: [Doc](https://github.com/gamer6456pro/Chess/blob/main/Doc.md)\
Youtube Video showcasing is here:

Note: If you want to use this make sure that the images and fonts paths are correct\
Also it highlights the moves put the king in check but if you try to move to those squares it's not possible so it's more of a visual bug :)
